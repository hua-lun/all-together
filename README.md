## Inspiration
As someone that likes to watch cooking competitions and participate in Hackathons, I wanted to combine the two and bring it
to content creation!

In these events, we are given limited time and sometimes, resources to work with. During past Hackathons, I find my inspirations
through the sponsors. I start to imagine what type of projects I can create with them. Plus, it is always fun to challenge 
yourself to make projects from the given resources.  

In content creation, sometimes you just don't know where to start. Should I create a cooking channel or gaming? How long 
should my videos be? There are so many questions. But, the best way to start creating, is to just practice, try till you
find your niche!

And, this is how `All Together` is made! Mixing and matching.

## What it does

`All-Together` is a content creation community made with many ingredients. It has 3 main features: 

1. Weekly Hackathon-style content creation contest. Every week, a prompt will be given and creators have to work within the
time limit and specified resources to create a video. 
2. Platform to share, ask, chat about anything related to creating content.
3. Self-help guide. 

- Receive video categories that are currently popular, daily. 
- Get top-viewing videos of each categories to learn what type of videos do well.
